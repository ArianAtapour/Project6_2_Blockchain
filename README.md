# Project6_2_Blockchain
Project 6.2 Blockchain NHL Stenden

## üïπÔ∏è About
This is the repository of IT2B from 2023. This project is a serious game for blockchain and logistics. The goal is to show the players that blockchain can make certain logistics tasks much easier. There are two games. One is just a classic logistics supply chain, while the other is the same but with blockchain implemented. Players, in groups of five, must choose their role in the process and have computers sent from the beginning, the request of the buyer, back to the buyer from the manufacturer in a whole line of logistics. The normal logistics way of the game focuses on sending individual messages to the next part in the line, while the blockchain focuses on sending the information through the blocks on the blockchain instead.

## ‚ùì How to play 
Players can find instructions on how to play the game within the game itself (once in the context page and again in each role).
