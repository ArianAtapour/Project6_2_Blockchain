//To ge around this we do <T extends object> so whatever passes through the generic MUST be of object type
//More specific we can allow only objects with certain properties for example <T extends {name:string}> will allow only objects that have the property of name of type string

//Tuples
/*
A tuple is a typed array with a pre-defined length and types for each index.
Tuples are great because they allow each element in the array to be a known
type of value.

*/

let tup:[string, number, boolean] = ['testTuple', 25, true]; //this is how we define a tuple in TS, we expect the following types inside the array string, number and boolean
//You can't change on the position of a string to have a number for example
//tup[0] = 25; //wont work
tup[0] = 'another string'; //but I can change it to another string

//As an fyi we can do it for 2 elements as well it does not to be 3 let tup:[string, number], the advantage is that we know the type
//The thing with tuples is that in vanilla java you can do whatever you want change it to any type but the rule with tuples is that you set like a 'template' to which you know what data types u expect.
