in app.component.ts I use <app-game1></app-game1>

you can switch that to <app-trigger></app-trigger> if we have only one variation of the game

<app-trigger></app-trigger>
is the main app



<app-game1></app-game1>
<app-game2></app-game2>
etc... are different variations of the game aka

game1:

questions:    1 - 2 - 3
answer index: 3 - 1 - 0


game2:


questions:    1 - 2 - 3
answer index: 2 - 3 - 2


game3:


questions:    1 - 2 - 3
answer index: 0 - 0 - 2

!!!!!!!THIS MEANS we have to make the game according to the questions and vice versa.
